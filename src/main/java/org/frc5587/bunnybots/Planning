(this file isn't .java bc it's just for words)

caroline: drivetrain ig?
Aiden: Elevator stuff, adding elevator deploy option

Xbox controller:
A: elevator up
B: elevator down
X = Grabbers spin inwards
Y = Grabbers spin outwards
Right Bumper = Grabbers open
Left Bumper = Grabbers close
Right Stick Button = Climber up (There should be a better way to do this)

Joystick:
drive train, will likely do that next period idk
x-axis: forward/reverse
y-axis: i forget, something to do with either spin or left/right


idk if you're looking at this but i figured out how to get the changes you pushed to Climber.java

//elevator forward backward, test
