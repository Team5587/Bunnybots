(this file isn't .java bc it's just for words)

caroline: drivetrain, some elevator stuff
Aiden:

    Xbox controller:
    A: elevator up
    B: elevator down
    X = Grabbers spin inwards
    Y = Grabbers spin outwards
    Right Bumper = Grabbers open
    Left Bumper = Grabbers close
    Right Stick Button = Climber up (There should be a better way to do this)

    Joystick:
    drive train, will likely do that next period idk
    y-axis: forward/reverse
    x-axis: spin


--- idk if you're looking at this but i figured out how to get the changes you pushed to Climber.java
    Awesome!
